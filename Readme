Components of the zip file >

ConnectorLib:
1. This has the search crawlers
2. Driver is responsible to setup the queries for different search crawlers.
3. Bing Search crawlers goes into next pages and fetches the results.
4. Google/Yahoo search crawlers are not implemented. Google public search urls are not supporting direct wget, hence wasted most of the time trying to find a usable url.

SearchService:
1. This is a restful jersey based app.
2. It uses the query path param to initialize the Driver and submit the search query.
